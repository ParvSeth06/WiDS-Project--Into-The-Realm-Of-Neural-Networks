# WiDS 2023- Into the Realm of Neural Networks

## Weekly Plan

### **Week 1**: Learning basic Python and NumPy
To brush up on the basics of Python, refer to [this YouTube tutorial on Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&vl=en), or the w3schools tutorials on [Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) and [NumPy](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp)


### **Week 2**: Learning about linear and logistic regression, the base of machine learning and their implementation
Complete [this Coursera Course on Supervised Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

### **Week 3**: Introduction to Deep Learning and Neural Networks, Simple NN on MNIST data set
- For a basic idea and visualization refer to [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&pp=iAQB)
- To learn about neural networks in depth, refer to the first three weeks' content from the [Coursera Course on Deep Learning & Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning)
- [MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset) for the assignment
