# WiDS 2023- Into the Realm of Neural Networks

## Project Overview

This project is a hands-on learning journey designed to introduce mentees to the exciting domains of deep learning, neural networks, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Over the course of four weeks, mentees will progress from mastering basic Python and NumPy to implementing advanced CNNs on real-world datasets.

### Mentors:
- Deeksha Dhiwakar
- Sharvanee Sonawane

### Project Highlights:

- **Python Fundamentals**: Start by acquiring a solid foundation in Python programming and harness the capabilities of NumPy for numerical computing.

- **Introduction to Machine Learning**: Explore the fundamentals of machine learning, focusing on linear and logistic regression. Implement these algorithms to understand their core principles.

- **Deep Dive into Neural Networks**: Venture into the world of deep learning with an introduction to neural networks. Implement a simple neural network on the MNIST dataset, gaining practical insights into the power of deep learning.

- **Unleashing the Power of CNNs**: Delve into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a specialized class of neural networks crucial for image processing. Apply CNNs to practical scenarios, starting with a cats and dogs dataset and progressing to the challenging CIFAR-10 dataset.
