# Week 3: Deep Learning and Neural Networks

## Neural Networks

Let's finally get started with neural networks! 

Neural networks are a class of machine learning techniques in which a computer learns to perform a task by analyzing training examples. They are pivotal in machine learning, serving as dynamic models that learn intricate patterns from data

We hope that you have already watched the four 3Blue1Brown videos from last week and have developed an intuitive understanding of neural networks. This week, we delve deeper into the concepts behind neural networks and the mathematics involved in them.

Once again, we will be following a Coursera course by Andrew NG, this time on [**Deep Learning and Neural Networks**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning). We recommend that you watch all the video lectures of the course **upto and including week 3 of the course** for a more comprehensive grasp of this week's material.

*Remember that just like last week, you do not need to enrol for the course, you can audit all the content for free.*

## PyTorch

For this week's assignment, and for the final project, we will be using yet another powerful Python library, **PyTorch**. PyTorch is an open-source deep learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It is a flexible and dynamic library, making it a popular choice for researchers and developers working on machine learning and deep learning projects.

[**Here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c36lUUr864M&pp=ygUcbmV1cmFsIG5ldHdvcmsgd2l0aCBweXRvcmNoIA%3D%3D) is the link to a YouTube playlist on Deep Learning using PyTorch which is a good source to start with. We recommend watching the video before attempting this week's assignment, as it will help you with the code.

Alternatively, you could use [**this YouTube tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzcBsTou0C0) as a reference to complete the assignments and proceed as required till the fourth video of the playlist. 

You just need to be familiar enough to know what to Google in case you get stuck :).

## Assignment

It's finally time for you to build your first neural network! We will be developing a classifier on the popular [MNIST Dataset](./MNIST_data.zip) that can identify handwritten digits. Please use the latter playlist linked in the previous section as a reference for the code, and always feel free to reach out to either of us in case of any difficulties. 

You will have to submit your code as a ```.ipynb``` file.

Deadline: 13 Jan 2024

*To use the dataset linked above, download it from this repo, unzip it and load it into your Jupyter notebook using Python's* ```pickle``` *library.*
