# Week 3: Deep Learning and Neural Networks

In this week, we finally get started with neural networks! [**Here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&pp=iAQB) is a short YouTube playlist to get you started.

Refer to [**this YouTube tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzcBsTou0C0) for a more exhaustive overview and implementation in code.

For a more in-depth study of the mathematics behind neural networks, refer to the first three weeks' content from the [**Coursera course on Deep Learning and Neural Networks**]. We understand that this may be a bit too heavy, please note that it is not mandatory to finish the course contents!
