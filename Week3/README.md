# Week 3: Deep Learning and Neural Networks

In this week, we finally get started with neural networks! 

Neural networks are a class of machine learning techniques in which a computer learns to perform a task by analyzing training examples. They are pivotal in machine learning, serving as dynamic models that learn intricate patterns from data

We hope that you have already watched the four 3Blue1Brown videos from last week and have developed an intuitive understanding of neural networks. This week, we delve deeper into the concepts behind neural networks and the mathematics involved in them.

Once again, we will be following a Coursera course by Andrew NG, this time on [**Deep Learning and Neural Networks**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning). We recommend that you watch all the video lectures of the course for a more comprehensive grasp of this week's material.

*Remember that just like last week, you do not need to enrol for the course, you can audit all the content for free.*

Refer to [**this YouTube tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzcBsTou0C0) for a more exhaustive overview and implementation in code.


## PyTorch

For this week's assignment, we will be using yet another powerful Python library, **PyTorch**. PyTorch is an open-source deep learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It is a flexible and dynamic library, making it a popular choice for researchers and developers working on machine learning and deep learning projects.

[**Here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzcBsTou0C0) is a YouTube video that explains some basic PyTorch functions commonly used in machine learning. We recommend watching this video before attempting this week's assignment.

Alternatively, you could use [**this YouTube tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c36lUUr864M&pp=ygUcbmV1cmFsIG5ldHdvcmsgd2l0aCBweXRvcmNoIA%3D%3D), but please note that it is much more extensive and covers a lot of functions that may not be relevant to this project. You can always find the functions you need 
## Assignment

It's finally time for you to build your first neural network! We will be developing a classifier on the popular [MNIST Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset) that can identify handwritten digits.
