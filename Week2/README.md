# Week 2: Linear and Logistic Regression

Before we begin developing full fledged neural networks, we begin by understanding one of the most fundamental machine learning techniques- regression.

In this week, you will understand the logic behind linear and logistic regression, and how we harness mathematical and computational power to solve problems.

The resources for this week will be the [**online course on Supervised Learning**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on Coursera by Andrew NG. It is highly recommended that you complete all the video tutorials by the end of this week.

You do not need to enrol for the course, you can audit all the content for free.
