# Week 1: Basics of Python and NumPy

## Python

Let's kick off this course by covering the basics of Python. It's completely fine if you're new to the language; it's one of the easiest to learn and won't take long to pick up.
Here are some tutorials to get you started:

- [**YouTube Tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw)
- [**w3schools**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) for reference

You don't need to cover the entire content of the video above, make sure to focus mainly on data types and the syntax for conditional statements, loops and functions.

## NumPy
NumPy, or Numerical Python, is a Python library widely used to operate on vectors and matrices (called *arrays*). It is arguably the most important Python library when it comes to developing neural networks and in data science in general. A major reason for NumPy's popularity is its use of *vectorization*, which greatly speeds up computations involving arrays, as compared to traditional Python lists.

Here are some tutorials on NumPy:

- [**w3schools**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp) (**recommended**)
- [**Official NumPy Documentation**](https://numpy.org/) for further reference as and when required

## Jupyter Notebooks
In this project, we'll be writing all our code in *Jupyter Notebooks*. They are widely used in data science as it makes it easy to write, run and manage code. Use [**this article**](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/) to complete the setup on your laptop.
