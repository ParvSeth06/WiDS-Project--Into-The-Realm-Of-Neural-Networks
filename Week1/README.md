# Week 1: Basics of Python and NumPy

## Python

Let's kick off this project by covering the basics of Python. It's completely fine if you're new to the language; it's one of the easiest to learn and won't take long to pick up.
Here are some tutorials to get you started:

- [**YouTube Tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw)
- [**w3schools**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) for reference

You don't need to cover the entire content of the video above, make sure to focus mainly on data types and the syntax for conditional statements, loops, functions  and basic file handling.

## NumPy
NumPy, or Numerical Python, is a Python library widely used to operate on vectors and matrices (called *arrays*). It is arguably the most important Python library when it comes to developing neural networks and in data science in general. A major reason for NumPy's popularity is its use of *vectorization*, which greatly speeds up computations involving arrays, as compared to traditional Python lists.

Here are some tutorials on NumPy:

- [**w3schools**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp) (**recommended**)
- [**Official NumPy Documentation**](https://numpy.org/) for further reference as and when required

Once you're done with the theory, we recommend that you attempt [**this optional assignment**](./Week1_NumPy_Assignment.ipynb) to practise using some popular NumPy functions. Make sure to download the Jupyter notebook from the repo before making changes to it.

## Jupyter Notebooks
Instead of building traditional Python scripts, in this project we will be using **Jupyter Notebooks** to write and run your code.

Jupyter notebooks allow you to divide your code into multiple cells that you can run individually one-by-one, allowing you to debug your code much more easily. You can go over the first few sections of [**this introductory document**](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/) for installation and basic functionalities or [**this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk) (only until Notebook creation and code execution)
