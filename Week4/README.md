# Week 4: Convolutional Neural Networks

## Introduction to CNNs

In the realm of image and pattern recognition, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be indispensable. Unlike traditional neural networks, CNNs are designed to efficiently process grid-like data, making them exceptionally well-suited for tasks like image classification. The key innovation lies in their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features directly from the data through convolutional layers.

[**Here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaSUYvmCekI) is the link to an MIT lecture that explains the concepts behind CNNs.


## Final Project

It's time to put together everything we've learned so far! For the final project, you will be implementing a Convolutional Neural Network on two datasets, first as a binary classifier and then as a ten-way classifier.
Point to consider: Ponder about the number of units in the output layer in both tasks.

### Part 1
The dataset for this part is the [Cats and Dogs dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765).
Use the fifth and sixth videos of [**this YouTube tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzcBsTou0C0) to go ahead with this task.

### Part 2
The dataset for this part is the more challenging [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
Follow [**this**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDdP0TFzsoQ) YouTube video as a reference for the implementation of the code.

Once again, you will have to submit your code in ```.ipynb``` files via a Google form that will be shared soon.
